# Solution to Assignment 4:

The purpose of the assignment is to learn Advanced python that will find its use further in the course.

## Problems given in the assignment were :

Write a code for sentiment analysis with following constraints:
- It has 3 LSTM layers
- It has used a for loop to do so in the forward function
- The dropout value used is 0.2
- Trained on the text that is reversed (for example "my name is Rohan" becomes "Rohan is name my"
- Achieves 87% or more accuracy
